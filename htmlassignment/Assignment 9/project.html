                <h2>Academic Project</h2>
                <p>I had done this project in the group of three students. I recieved a grant of 38,350 Rs. from Design & Innovation Centre (DIC), GTU. This project works on the principle of expansion and contraction of shape memory alloys in the hot temperature bath. We created an experimental setup to evaluate the performance of solar water heater and the Nitinol heat engine. We used Nickel-Titanium alloy as a shape memory product. It converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. We attached the Nitinol heat engine (a vertical chain and sprocket type structure consisting of small and big pulleys and one wounded wire around them.) with solar water heater to get hot temperature bath, when it gets in contact with hot water the temperature of Nitinol wire increases at lower end and the upper end consisting of bigger pulley is in direct contact with air. Due to this hot and cold temperature difference between lower end and upper end of wire tries to rotate and we got mechanical shaft power. By attaching an alternator we can convert this obtained mechanical shaft energy to electrical power.</p>
