                <h1>About Cricket</h1>
                <p>Cricket is a game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps with the main thing Bat and Ball.</p>
                <p>Cricket encourages teamwork. I think cricket is much better than sitting hours in front of the computer screen or playing video games. When I study after playing, I am able to concentrate better and grasp concepts faster. My passion for playing cricket has also won me the best bowler in my school cricket team.</p>
                <p>When I play cricket I am very much happy. I always want's to bowl first. Also my favourite player is Mitchell Starc. I bowl very well. I used to field at boundary sides. I am very good catcher also.</p>
