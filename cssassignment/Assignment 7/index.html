                <p>The India No.3 batter, if not available, could be replaced by the in-form Sarfaraz Khan in the eleven for the first Test against New Zealand. India's Test No.3 Shubman Gill remains a doubtful starter for the first Test against New Zealand starting here on Wednesday. Gill has been on the physio's table to treat his stiff neck.</p>

                <p>If Gill doesn't recover in time, it will open an opportunity for Sarfaraz Khan with KL Rahul likely to be pushed up to No.3. Sarfaraz has been waiting in the wings after an impressive start to his Test career where he scored 200 runs in three Tests against England, including three fifties, early this year. It's difficult for us to make a call on him, whether he'll be fit for this series.</p>

                <p>Bengaluru's persistent rain has raised doubts about the first Test result between India and New Zealand, with the first day entirely washed out. The forecast for the coming days also remains bleak, creating uncertainty for the match. India recently pulling off a result despite adverse weather against Bangladesh. The team may need to replicate this feat against the Kiwis if any play occurs.</p>

                <p>Ben Sears, the New Zealand pacer, has been ruled out of the three-match Test series against India due to a knee injury. The uncapped Jacob Duffy has been named as the replacement for Sears and will fly to India on Wednesday (October 16) morning.</p>
